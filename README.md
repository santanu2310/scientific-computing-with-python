# Disclaimer:

The code and content provided in this project, which are part of the FreeCodeCamp certification program, are intended solely for educational purposes and should not be copied or used for the purpose of completing your own certification projects. 

FreeCodeCamp's certification program is designed to help individuals develop their coding skills by providing hands-on projects and challenges. While we encourage you to learn from the provided projects, it is essential that you complete the projects independently and showcase your own understanding and abilities.

Copying and submitting the code from these projects as your own would undermine the purpose of the certification program and devalue the skills and knowledge gained through the learning process. Plagiarism is not only unethical but also hampers your personal growth as a developer.

We strongly recommend that you approach the FreeCodeCamp projects as opportunities to apply what you have learned, experiment with different approaches, and seek assistance from the FreeCodeCamp community if needed. By completing the projects authentically, you will gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and improve your coding skills.

In summary, it is important to emphasize that copying the FreeCodeCamp projects for certification purposes is not permitted. Instead, use the projects as a learning resource to enhance your skills, apply your knowledge independently, and demonstrate your capabilities to achieve a meaningful certification.
